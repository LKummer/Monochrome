By the end of this guide you should have a Hugo site ready to be generated.

## Quick Start Site

The theme has a quickstart-site archive for every release. The archive contains a
demo blog ready with the theme already set up inside.

Head over to the theme's releases on Github
and download the quickstart-site archive of the latest version.

After downloading, extract the quickstart site into an empty directory. The site
should be ready to build.

## Building the Site

Make sure to use a Hugo version newer than `0.65`.

To build the site, open a command line in the quickstart site's directory and
run Hugo:

```bash
$ hugo
```

To run a hot reload dev server, run:

```bash
$ hugo server
```

## Further Customization
